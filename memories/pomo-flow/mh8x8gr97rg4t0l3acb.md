User Preference: NEVER claim success or say something is "working" without thorough Playwright MCP browser testing. User confirmation is REQUIRED. Visual restoration is the ONLY thing that matters - state capture is meaningless without visual results. Avoid exaggerated language like "BREAKTHROUGH" or "SUCCESS!". Use neutral, factual language. Always verify file counts and system status with actual commands before making claims.
