Groups vs Sections Implementation Status: Phase 1 (terminology) and Phase 2 (SectionWizard component) are COMPLETE. The wizard supports 4 section types: Priority, Status, Timeline, and Project. "Create Section (Smart)" button was accidentally deleted in commit b6fc0c4 during linter revert but has been restored. Wizard now opens from canvas context menu (right-click on empty canvas). Current branch: feature/groups-vs-sections-wizard. Dev server running on port 5551 (ports 5546-5550 in use).
