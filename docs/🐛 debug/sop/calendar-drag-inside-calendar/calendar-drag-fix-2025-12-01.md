# SOP: Calendar Drag Inside Calendar Fix

**Date:** December 1, 2025
**Status:** Partial Fix (Drag working, Resize still needs work)
**Affected Files:** `src/views/CalendarView.vue`, `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarDayView.ts`

---

## Problem Description

Calendar daily view had broken functionality:
1. **Resize handles not appearing** on hover over calendar tasks
2. **Dragging top/bottom resize handles** not working
3. **Dragging tasks within calendar** (e.g., 9:00 AM → 2:00 PM) not working

User-reported symptoms:
- Hover over calendar task → resize handles NOT appearing at top/bottom
- Drag top resize handle → NOT working
- Drag bottom resize handle → NOT working
- Drag task from one time slot to another → NOT working

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug: CSS Position Override

**Location:** `src/views/CalendarView.vue` lines 1796-1801 (before fix)

```css
/* BROKEN RULE - This was causing the issue */
.time-slot:hover .resize-handle {
  pointer-events: auto;
  position: relative;  /* ← THIS BREAKS EVERYTHING */
  z-index: 10;
}
```

### Why This Broke Resize Handles

1. **Base CSS (correct):** `.resize-handle` has `position: absolute` + `top: 0` / `bottom: 0`
   - This positions handles at the top and bottom edges of the task element

2. **Broken hover rule:** When hovering `.time-slot` (parent container), it changed position to `relative`
   - With `position: relative`, handles enter normal document flow
   - `top: 0` and `bottom: 0` no longer position them at task edges
   - Handles become displaced and effectively invisible

3. **CSS Specificity Issue:**
   - `.time-slot:hover .resize-handle` = specificity 0,2,0 (20)
   - `.slot-task.is-primary:hover .resize-handle` = specificity 0,4,0 (40)
   - The higher specificity hover rule sets `opacity`/`pointer-events`/`background`
   - But it does NOT set `position`, so the broken `position: relative` still applies

### DOM Structure Context

```
.time-slot (hover triggers broken rule)
  └── .slot-task.is-primary
       └── .resize-handle.resize-top    (position: absolute → relative on hover)
       └── .resize-handle.resize-bottom (position: absolute → relative on hover)
```

## The Fix

### What Was Changed

**File:** `src/views/CalendarView.vue`

**Action:** Removed the entire broken CSS rule block (lines 1796-1801):

```css
/* REMOVED - was breaking resize handles */
/* Allow pointer events to pass through time slots when hovering over resize handles */
.time-slot:hover .resize-handle {
  pointer-events: auto;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

### Correct CSS (Already Existed)

The following CSS rules were already correct and remain in place:

```css
/* Base resize handle styling (lines ~1685-1696) */
.resize-handle {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 8px;
  background: transparent;
  cursor: ns-resize;
  z-index: 20;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: all var(--duration-fast);
  pointer-events: none;
}

.resize-handle.resize-top {
  top: 0;
}

.resize-handle.resize-bottom {
  bottom: 0;
}

/* Hover state (lines ~1708-1712) */
.slot-task.is-primary:hover .resize-handle {
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: auto;
  background: rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.4);
}
```

## Verification Results

### After Fix - What Works

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Resize handles in DOM | ✅ Working | Elements exist with correct classes |
| Resize handle positioning | ✅ Fixed | `position: absolute`, `top: 0px`, `bottom: 0px` |
| CSS hover rule | ✅ Correct | Sets `opacity: 1`, `pointerEvents: auto` |
| Drag within calendar | ✅ Working | Task moved from slot 18 (9:00) to slot 28 (14:00) |
| Drag from inbox to calendar | ✅ Working | Task instance created on drop |
| Resize handler triggered | ✅ Working | Console shows resize start/complete |

### After Fix - What Still Needs Work

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Visual resize handles on hover | ⚠️ Needs manual test | CSS :hover requires real mouse cursor |
| Actual resize functionality | ❌ Not working per user | Handler fires but resize may not apply |

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing (Playwright)

```javascript
// Check resize handle CSS
const resizeTop = document.querySelector('.resize-handle.resize-top');
const styles = window.getComputedStyle(resizeTop);
// Verify: position === 'absolute', top === '0px'

// Check CSS hover rule exists
const sheets = document.styleSheets;
for (const sheet of sheets) {
  for (const rule of sheet.cssRules) {
    if (rule.selectorText?.includes('.slot-task.is-primary:hover .resize-handle')) {
      // Verify: opacity === '1', pointerEvents === 'auto'
    }
  }
}

// Test drag within calendar
const dragData = JSON.stringify({ taskId, source: 'calendar-event' });
// Dispatch dragstart, dragover, drop events
// Verify task moved to new slot
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. [ ] Navigate to Calendar view (Day mode)
2. [ ] Schedule a task from inbox to calendar
3. [ ] Hover over the scheduled task
4. [ ] Verify purple resize handles appear at top and bottom
5. [ ] Drag bottom handle down → duration should increase
6. [ ] Drag top handle up → start time should change
7. [ ] Drag task body to different time slot → task should move

## Console Debug Logs

When drag/resize is working, you should see these logs:

```
🎯 [CalendarDrag] handleEventDragStart called {taskId: ..., instanceId: ...}
🎨 [CalendarDrag] Drag state activated {isDragging: true, ...}
📤 [CalendarDrag] Setting drag data: {...}
🔄 [CalendarDrag] handleDragOver called {slotIndex: ..., slotTime: ...}
🎯 CALENDAR DROP: Task "..." dropped on ... at ...
🎯 CALENDAR DROP: Updated task instance ... to ... at ...
🔄 [CalendarDrag] Forced calendarEvents recomputation after drop

🚀 [CalendarResize] Resize started {taskId: ..., direction: ..., originalTime: ...}
🔄 [CalendarResize] Bottom resize: duration X → Y
🏁 [CalendarResize] Resize completed
```

## Related Issues

- Resize still not working visually - may need additional CSS or handler fixes
- Previous SOPs existed in git commit `bc2011c` but were deleted
- Related composable: `useCalendarDragCreate.ts` - handles new task creation via drag

---

## Next Steps for Resize Fix

1. Verify `startResize()` handler is actually being called on mousedown
2. Check if `pointer-events: auto` is applying on hover (may need explicit position override)
3. Consider adding `position: absolute !important` to hover state
4. Test resize handle z-index vs task content z-index
5. Verify mousedown event is not being blocked by other elements
