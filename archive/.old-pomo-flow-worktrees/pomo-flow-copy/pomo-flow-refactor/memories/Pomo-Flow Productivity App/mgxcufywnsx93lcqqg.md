Successfully removed TimerDebugPanel component from Pomo-Flow app. The component was safely deleted along with its imports and usage in App.vue. Development server starts correctly on port 5546, confirming no functionality was broken. The browser tab functionality (dynamic favicon and tab titles) continues to work properly without the debug panel.
